# ðŸ›’ Retail Sales SQL Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`  

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using **SQL**, specifically within **Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)**. The focus is on simulating a real-world retail business scenario where transactional sales data is analyzed for actionable insights.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
To design a clean retail sales database, explore and clean raw data, and perform insightful SQL queries to identify customer trends, peak sales periods, high-value transactions, and performance across product categories.

---

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

- **Database Design & Setup**: Created a normalized schema with appropriate data types and constraints to store transactional retail sales data.
- **Data Cleaning & Validation**: Identified and removed null or incomplete records using SQL filtering techniques to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Exploration**: Executed queries to understand data distribution, spot inconsistencies, and profile customer demographics and product segments.
- **Advanced SQL Analysis**:
  - Used `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` for aggregations.
  - Applied **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** and **Window Functions (`RANK()`)** for complex logic like identifying the best-selling month per year.
  - Used `CASE` statements to segment data into time-based shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
- **Business Insights**:
  - Identified top-spending customers and high-value transactions.
  - Highlighted product categories with the highest revenue and most unique buyers.
  - Analyzed sales performance trends by month and customer demographics.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

**Database Creation:**  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE retails_db;
```

**Table Creation:**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
```

- **Unique Customer Count**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
```

- **Unique Categories**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
```

- **Null Value Check**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

- **Remove Null Records**
```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

- **Sales on 2022-11-05**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

- **Clothing Sales with Quantity > 4 in November 2022**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
AND quantity >= 4
AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30';
```

- **Total Sales by Category**
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS TotalSaleOfEachCategory
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

- **Average Age of Beauty Buyers**
```sql
SELECT AVG(age) AS Average_Age FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty';
```

- **Transactions Over $1000**
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

- **Transaction Count by Gender and Category**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(transactions_id) AS transactions, gender, category
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY gender, category
ORDER BY transactions DESC;
```

- **Best-Selling Month in Each Year**
```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT 
        YEAR(sale_date) AS sales_year,
        MONTH(sale_date) AS sales_month,
        ROUND(AVG(total_sale),2) AS average_monthly_sales
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
),
RankedMonths AS (
    SELECT 
        sales_year,
        sales_month,
        average_monthly_sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales_year ORDER BY average_monthly_sales DESC) AS rnk
    FROM MonthlySales
)
SELECT 
    sales_year,
    sales_month,
    average_monthly_sales
FROM RankedMonths
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY sales_year;
```

- **Top 5 Customers by Total Sales**
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY net_sale DESC;
```

- **Unique Customers per Category**
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS count_unique_customer
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

- **Orders by Time Shift**
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END AS shift,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END
ORDER BY number_of_orders DESC;
```
